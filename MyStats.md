I like reading and understanding people.I am not too fond of people getting emotional for small things. I admire emotionally strong people.
I rely completely on my ability to work hard to excel at anything. I like helping strangers get through their problems if I’m stable myself. I don’t do it as often as I used to. I am mostly good with my choice of words while interacting with people. People tend to trust me easily. I find it hard to decide when to give up on something.
