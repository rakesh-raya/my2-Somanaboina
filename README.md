###### My favourite vacation spot is Mumbai city located in Maharashtra

**"Mumbai, where every corner has a story to tell"**. I love Mumbai as a vacation spot because it is one of the biggest cities in India and has wide variety of tourism spots from best Beaches to beautifully built city with Historical structures, Temples and many other spots nearby like Gateway of Mumbai, Chathrapathi Shivaji Terminus, Marine Drive, Shri Siddivinayak Temple, Juhu beach, Chowpatty beach, Elephanta caves and nearby beautiful nature spots like Lonavala are wonderful to experience. Also the famous food in Mumbai is Vada pav which is my favourite. Finally, **"In Mumbai, the past and the future coexist in a chaotic but beautiful harmony"**.
